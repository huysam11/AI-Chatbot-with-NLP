Chatbots are nothing but applications that are used by businesses or other entities to conduct an automatic conversation between a human and an AI. These conversations may be via text or speech. Chatbots are required to understand and mimic human conversation while interacting with humans from all over the world   
NLP stands for Natural Language Processing. Using NLP technology, you can help a machine understand human speech and spoken words. NLP combines computational linguistics that is the rule-based modelling of the human spoken language with intelligent algorithms such as statistical, machine, and deep learning algorithms. These technologies together create the smart voice assistants and chatbots that you may be used in everyday life
